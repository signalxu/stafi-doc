# Introduction

Welcome to the StaFi Protocol documentation.


## What is StaFi
StaFi is the first multi-chain liquid staking token (LST) protocol that unlocks the liquidity of staked assets. StaFi aims to solve the contradiction between mainnet security and token liquidity in PoS consensus. StaFi allows users to stake their tokens without locking their assets or maintaining infrastructure, while still participating in on-chain activities.

- Staking pool: Protocol to manage deposits, staking rewards, and withdrawals. 
- rToken: The token holders are staking through staking contracts built in StaFi protocol, and then get alternative tokens(rToken ,such as rETH, rMATIC, rATOM, rBNB, rSOL etc.), rTokens are tradable and it can get staking rewards from original chain at the same time.
- Goverance: StaFi protocol is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the liquid staking protocol. The DAO is governed by the community and core team, who make decisions on key parameters, such as setting fees and selecting node operators. The DAO also accumulates service fees, which are used to fund research, development, liquidity mining incentives, and protocol upgrades.
